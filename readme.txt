This is a simple server written with NodeJS: Express framework + mongoDB
To run it locally:
We need to define environmental variable in the terminal: 
$env:vidly_jwtPrivatekey="mySecureKey"
We need to run mongod in another terminal window - to have mongoDB server running
Server is listening on port 3900.
